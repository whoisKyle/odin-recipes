    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy to make pasta with baked feta inspired by current TikTok trends.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 pints cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves peeled garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon zest</li>
        <li>8 ounce feta cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounce penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup baby spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Remove feta-tomato mixture from the oven. Mash garlic, tomatoes, onions, and peppers with a heavy spoon and mix with the feta cheese, creating a sauce. Stir in spinach and cooked pasta. The spinach will get cooked from the heat of the pasta sauce and pasta. Add pasta water, a little at a time if needed, to reach desired consistency. Mix well and serve.

    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
